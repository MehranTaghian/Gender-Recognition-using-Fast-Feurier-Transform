Typical human speech ranges between 50 Hz and 300 Hz. Most men typically range between 85-180Hz, and most women between 165-255Hz. If we look at a spectrum of audio for English speakers, we get a pretty substantial diï¬€erence between the genders. This is of course not super surprising to anyone with a pair of ears

There are numerous techniques used to distinguish between male and female voice with above 99% accuracy. In this project, you need to implement a simple technique that is based on pick frequencies in male/female power spectrums. 
Peak frequency is measured as 122 Hz for male speakers 212 Hz for females.

This part has been implemented using matlab. The project has been tested using a dataset of 12 voices of male and female.
